# FactOfTheDayWebsite
This project is available on A Cloud Guru Youtube Channel. I followed the instructions to implement it. 
Basically, we will build a website, and perform some attacks on it, a form of Chaos Engineering, to learn how to test our system to be reliable. 
The System Architecture:
- AWS EC2 Instance
- AWS DynamoDB
- AWS Cognito
- Gremlin Account
All files, steps and commands used are available in this repo.
