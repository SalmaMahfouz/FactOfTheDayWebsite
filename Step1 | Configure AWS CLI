1. Configure our AWS CLI, as part of that is to create a new IAM user, with admin level privileges, because it will need permissions to create Cognito resources. Then we will configure the AWS CLI using the credentials of this user. 
2. While creating the IAM user, we need to give a programmatic access. To do so, after creating the user & giving it “AdministratorAccess” permission. We need to generate access for this user. 
3. Configure the AWS CLI: aws configure
4. Insert the Access ID & Secret Key of the IAM User we created.
